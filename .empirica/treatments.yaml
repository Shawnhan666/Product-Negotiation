After 10 minutes, an <strong>official vote</strong> will be conducted where the CEO will propose a set of product features and the two department heads will vote “YES” or “NO” to them. Only official vote results will affect earnings.           <br />           <br />           You can see your role and priority features at the bottom of the main negotiations page.
